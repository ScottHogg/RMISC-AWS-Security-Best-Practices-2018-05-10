# RMISC-AWS-Security-Best-Practices-2018-05-10
AWS Security Best Practices presentation given at the Rocky Mountain Information Security Conference on 5/10/18

Here is the presentation that I gave at this conference.
The other part of this presentation was a live demonstration running in AWS with many of the security features enabled.

The AWS environment was based on the NIST QuickStart Templates.
